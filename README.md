# 🧠 Nim Projects Collection

Welcome to my collection of projects written in [**Nim**](https://nim-lang.org) — a powerful, expressive systems programming language with Python-like syntax and C-level performance.

This repository features a diverse set of projects ranging from algorithms and cryptography to blockchain simulations and system utilities.

## 🚀 Projects Overview

### 🔤 Auto Complete System
An efficient text autocomplete engine using a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** for fast prefix matching.

### 📇 Get Contact Number
A contact manager where names and phone numbers are stored in a **BST**. Supports insert, search, update, and traversal.

### 🔗 Blockchain Simulation
Simulates core blockchain mechanisms:
- **Proof of Work (PoW)**
- **Proof of Stake (PoS)**
Great for learning how consensus mechanisms work under the hood.

### 🧾 Change File Detection
Monitors file content and detects changes using hashing techniques.

### 🗃️ Check Duplicate Files
Scans folders and detects duplicate files using file hashes.

### 🔐 Cryptography Toolkit
A collection of classic and modern ciphers implemented in Nim:
- Caesar Cipher
- Vigenère Cipher
- XOR
- Substitution
- ...and more!

### 📦 Hash Data
Generates cryptographic hash values for text and files (MD5, SHA256, etc.).

### 📚 Plagiarism Checker
Detects similarity between texts using:
- **SimHash**
- **TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity**
Ideal for checking document overlap and content originality.

### 🌐 TCP Handshake Simulation
Simulates the **3-way TCP handshake** process to help understand network connection establishment.
